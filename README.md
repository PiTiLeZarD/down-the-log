# DownTheLog

## Why another logbook?

I've been testing and using many logbooks, and being a coder, it's a little frustrating to see the diff between what's possible and what's done.

So I'll try my own flavour, let's see if I get anywhere. My inspiration are QSOSecretary which is my prime way of logging at the moment. Then I export and use RUMlogNG to fluff up my logs. I'd like to not have to do that ;)

## Where am I right now?

Well, check out the [demo here](https://pitilezard.github.io/down-the-log/)

It also works on mobile as an app, ios and android (not deployed anywhere yet, I'm waiting until I have a finished product)
It also works as a desktop app (windows/osx) (same deal, I can run it but I didn't build anything yet for the world)

## What are my goals?

I'm keeping a [todolist](TODO.md) up to date, or try to anyway.

But in a nutshell, I'd like to have all the goodies in a good looking app (don't judge, it'll be better, it's a work in progress)

## You want to try it for yourself?

```
yarn install
```

VSCode should give you the commands needed to run everything when you CMD+SHFT+B, otherwise check the package.json
